# Car Sales Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of used car listings to uncover pricing trends, buyer behavior, and inventory opportunities across various cities and fuel types. By leveraging **MS Excel**, I transformed raw data into a strategic tool that highlights high-value segments and market-specific opportunities.

## Data Cleaning & Integrity

To ensure **data integrity** and transparency for stakeholders, original data columns were preserved alongside cleaned versions to allow for full transformation tracing.

* **Missing Value Imputation**: Used model-wise medians to fill gaps in Mileage and Power data.


* **Normalization**: Standardized pricing units (Lakh normalization) and flagged 1,234 blank entries for review.


* **Outlier Management**: Preserved an extreme 6.5 million km outlier in "Kilometers Driven" to maintain data transparency.


* **Contextual Logic**: Resolved blanks and inconsistencies in "Owner Type" and "Fuel Type" using business logic.

## Data Modeling

Advanced Excel techniques were used to add analytical depth to the dataset:

* **Granular Segmentation**: Utilized **Text-to-Column** to split car names into **Brand** and **Model**, enabling specific analysis of brand performance and pricing tiers.
